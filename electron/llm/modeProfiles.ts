// electron/llm/modeProfiles.ts
//
// MODE-AWARE ROUTING PRIOR (Profile Intelligence v3, W1).
//
// The active ModesManager mode ("sales", "lecture", "technical-interview", …)
// is a strong PRIOR on what an AMBIGUOUS turn is about: an unmatched question
// in a sales call is almost certainly a sales question, not a meeting recap.
// Until now `planAnswer` was mode-blind — every fallthrough landed on
// unknown_answer / general_meeting_answer regardless of the live setting, which
// is exactly the "doesn't answer / answers generically" failure mode.
//
// DESIGN RULE (leak-safety invariant): the mode is a prior, NEVER an override.
// Explicit answer-type signals (coding verbs, negotiation words, identity asks,
// profile probes, …) always win — this module is consulted ONLY on the final
// classification fallthrough, after every explicit pattern has had its chance.
// Redirecting the fallthrough TYPE is the whole mechanism: the per-type
// required/forbidden layer tables in AnswerPlanner then apply automatically
// (sales_answer already forbids resume/jd/negotiation, lecture_answer already
// requires reference_files, …), so no layer rule is ever relaxed here.
//
// Pure data + pure functions. No I/O, no LLM, no imports with side effects —
// trivially testable and safe on the hot path.

/**
 * THE single declaration of the mode universe: sales (the product) plus general
 * (the neutral fallback — `general_meeting_answer` below is a load-bearing floor
 * type, which is why general is kept rather than collapsing to one mode).
 *
 * It lives here, in the leaf llm/ layer, rather than in services/ModesManager
 * because services/ imports from llm/ and never the other way round.
 * ModesManager re-exports it so existing `import { ModeTemplateType } from
 * '../services/ModesManager'` call sites keep working.
 *
 * It used to be hand-copied into ModesManager, modeSourceContract, ModeGenerator,
 * MeetingModeDetector and PostCallWorkflow. The comment here claimed drift
 * "would surface as a type error at the call sites" — it does not, and two of
 * those copies had already silently drifted (both were missing 'seminar').
 * Import it; do not re-declare it.
 *
 * NOTE: llm/ProviderRouter.ts has an unrelated type with the SAME NAME
 * ('sales' | 'recruiting' | 'interview' | 'default') that drives provider
 * fallback order. Do not conflate them.
