// electron/intelligence/ProfileTreeService.ts
//
// Spec Phase 2 — the canonical, deterministic "Profile Tree" read API. The spec
// asks for ProfileTreeService.getIdentity()/getProjects()/getExperience()/
// getSkills()/getEducation()/getRoleFit()/getCompactIdentityBlock()/
// getInterviewIntro().
//
// THIS IS A FACADE, NOT A REWRITE. Natively already selects source-aware profile
// evidence via electron/llm/manualProfileIntelligence.ts (`selectManualProfileEvidence`),
// the same selector used by live manual-chat/WTA JIT paths. This service DELEGATES
// to that selector with canonical question phrasing, then returns the compact JIT
// prompt that a provider must answer from. It does not render final prose.
// The output is therefore aligned with the product's single evidence source of truth.
//
// Why a class with per-instance profile (not module functions): it structurally
// guarantees the spec's privacy/isolation requirement. An instance built for Bob
// holds ONLY Bob's facts and has no reference to anyone else's — cross-user leakage
// is impossible by construction, not by a runtime check. (See privacy-isolation
// test: Bob's ProfileTreeService can never surface Alice's project.)
//
// Determinism guarantees required by the spec acceptance criteria:
//   • identity/intro/projects/experience/skills/education answer from structure,
//   • NEVER "I am Natively" (assistant-meta asks bail; these methods ask candidate
//     questions, so they always answer AS the candidate),
//   • NEVER "I don't know" when a profile exists (returns the grounded string, or
//     null only when that specific facet is genuinely absent from the profile).
