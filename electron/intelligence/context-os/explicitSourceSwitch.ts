// electron/intelligence/context-os/explicitSourceSwitch.ts
//
// Context OS (evidence-execution-repair, 2026-07-11) — canonical explicit
// source-switch detection, resolved BEFORE the turn contract is built.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the prior architecture let Profile Intelligence
// INDEPENDENTLY decide "this looks like a JD question" (via its own
// selectedContextLayers heuristic inside buildManualProfileEvidenceRoute)
// while the SourceAuthorityKernel's contract remained locked at
// reference_files_only — a hard architectural contradiction: the canonical
// contract said "no profile, no JD" while a parallel system silently
// selected and rendered JD content into the prompt anyway. Root cause:
// `_contractAllowsProfile` (ipcHandlers.ts) checked only profile_resume/
// profile_project, never profile_jd — so a JD-only leak sailed through a
// gate that LOOKED like it covered "profile" but didn't cover JD.
//
// THE FIX: resolve the user's explicit source intent ONCE, generically (no
// document/company/mode names hardcoded), BEFORE any contract or evidence
// selection happens. The result feeds `userExplicitSource` into
// buildCustomModeExecutionContract/SourceAuthorityKernel — which ALREADY
// had first-class support for this input (customModeExecutionContract.ts's
// `userExplicitSource` param, SourceAuthorityKernel's explicit-switch
// branches) but no real caller ever populated it. This module is that
// caller.
//
// An explicit switch changes ONLY the current turn's contract. It never
// mutates the mode's persisted ModeSourceContract default (verified by
// construction: this module returns a value, never writes to ModesManager).
